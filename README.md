# HaloTeamBalancer
This was designed to make it easier to balance teams of random known people.
Just go into the settings directory and modify the Players.csv file with all of the gamertags and CSRs of the people you want to balance teams for.
Then load the application. it will pull everyone's gamertag into a list. you just double click or select and hit enter on a name and that player will be added to the list to be sorted.
Then click the sort button and a red team and blue team will be created with the lowest CSR difference it can figure out.
The clear button resets everything like the application just started.
At this time, if you want to add to the player pool, exiting the application and modifying the csv file is the only way. This will be improved at some point.
I also want to make it so double clicking someone on the 'to be sorted' list removes that person.
